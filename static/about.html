				<h1>Pickletrack</h1>
				<p>Pickletrack helps find the closest bars to you in New York City that serve picklebacks. Currently, this includes the four boroughs Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and The Bronx.</p>
				<p>Results are selected randomly from bars within three miles, favoring bars that are closer from those further away.</p>
				<p>All data is sourced from <a href="https://foursquare.com">Foursquare</a> and updated regularly. To have a bar included in the results, add a review mentioning picklebacks to the venue page on Foursquare.</p>
